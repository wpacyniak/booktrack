# BOOKTRACK

This app is my first experience in web development. It includes free section - first is main page with some quote, second is a draft of my resume and the last section is the main clue of this project - booktrack. It offers a few functions - the user can:
* add a read book (giving details about it and rating it),
* check the list of read books in specific year (in this page there is also a graph visualizing the number of pages read by a month in a year),
* add a bookplan and then mark it as a read on,
* and also check a list of bookplans.
This project enable me to learn basics of web programming and as a result of this I find out that this area of IT is something that I'm really interested in.
